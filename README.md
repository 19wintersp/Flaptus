# Flaptus

A cactus themed Flappy Bird implementation with Ruby's Gosu gem.

In Flaptus you hop around the world of a singular cactus and lots of yellow pipes. Do what you can to not get hit by the pipes or touch the floor. Points are collected by passing through a pair of pipes, but watch out, the pipes come at you faster as you get more points! When you close Flaptus by pressing `Esc`, don't worry, your high and average score is saved so you can come back in a few hours and carry on the Flaptus high score grind.
