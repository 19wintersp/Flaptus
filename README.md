# Flaptus

A cactus themed Flappy Bird implementation with Ruby's Gosu gem.

In Flaptus you hop around the world of a singular cactus and lots of columns of rocks. Do what you can to not get hit by the rocks or touch the floor. Points are collected by passing through a pair of rock columns, but watch out, the rocks come at you faster as you get more points! Your high and average score is saved so you can leave and come back in a few hours and carry on the Flaptus high score grind.
